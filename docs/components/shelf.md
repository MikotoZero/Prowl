## What it is

Shelf lays your worktrees out as thin vertical **spines** ("books") on the sides,
with the currently open book's terminal filling the center. Each spine shows the
project icon/name (rotated) and a column of its **tabs** as small icon slots.
When Prowl detects agents in that book, the bottom of the spine also shows compact
agent badges with their current status.
Books near the open one are brighter; distant ones fade — so you always know where
you are in the stack.

**Toggle Shelf:** `⌘⇧↩` (`toggle_shelf`). Requires at least one open worktree;
otherwise it's a no-op.

## Keyboard navigation (the whole point)

| Action | Key |
|--------|-----|
| Flip to **next book** (worktree) | `⌘⌃→` |
| Flip to **previous book** | `⌘⌃←` |
| Jump to **book 1–9** | `⌥⌃1` … `⌥⌃9` |
| Cycle the open book's **tabs** | `⌘⌃↓` (next) / `⌘⌃↑` (previous) |
| Select the open book's **tab 1–9** | `⌘1` … `⌘9` |

So `⌘⌃←/→` moves **between agents**, and `⌘⌃↑/↓` moves **between that agent's
tabs** — triage six in-flight agents one keystroke at a time.

Two-finger horizontal swipes on the trackpad also flip between books: swipe left
to move to the book on the right, and swipe right to move to the book on the
left. Book switching is bounded at the shelf edges; it does not wrap around.
Vertical scrolling inside the terminal keeps working normally; Shelf only
consumes a swipe after the horizontal movement clearly dominates.

## Interacting with spines

- **Open a book:** click anywhere on a closed spine (it activates and shows its
  terminal).
- **Select a tab:** click a tab slot on the open book's spine.
- **New tab:** the **+** at the bottom of a spine. On a closed book, **+** opens
  the book and creates the tab.
- **Jump to an agent:** click an agent badge at the bottom of a spine. It focuses
  that agent's worktree, tab, and pane.
- **Split:** the open book's spine has **split-vertical** and **split-horizontal**
  buttons (Ghostty `new_split:right` / `new_split:down`).
- **Close a tab:** hover a tab slot → its **×**.
- **Tab context menu:** right-click a tab slot → Rename, Change Icon, Close, Close
  Others, Close to Right, Close All.
- **Spine header context menu:** right-click → **Repo Settings**, **Close
  Worktree/Folder** (closes all its tabs, removing the book).

While holding `⌘`, the open book overlays its tab slots with `1…9` hints for quick
selection.

## Visual cues

- **Open book:** full-strength color. **Neighbors:** ~50%. Farther books fade
  progressively — a proximity ladder that keeps the stack readable.
- **Unread notification:** a tab slot highlights orange; the spine header shows an
  orange dot.
- **Detected agents:** compact badges appear at the bottom of the owning spine.
  Badge color/status follows the Active Agents states (Working, Blocked, Done,
  Idle); blocked agents are prioritized first. Shelf keeps agent detection active
  while visible, even if the Active Agents panel is hidden.
- Spine tint follows the **repository color** when set (toggle
  `shelfSpineTintFollowsRepositoryColor`); otherwise a fallback
  (`shelfSpineTintFallback`: neutral or system tint) is used.
- In Shelf, the toolbar and leading band are tinted with the open book's repo
  color (`windowTintMode`).

## Empty state

If no book is open, the center shows "No worktree selected" with a books icon;
spines stay visible so you can pick one.

## Settings that affect Shelf

- `defaultViewMode` — launch directly into Shelf.
- `shelfSpineTintFollowsRepositoryColor` — color spines by repo color.
- `shelfSpineTintFallback` — `neutral` or `systemTint` when a repo has no color.
- `windowTintMode` / repository colors — chrome tinting.

## When to recommend Shelf vs Canvas

- **Shelf** = linear, keyboard-driven, see-one-at-a-time triage of many
  worktrees. Fastest way to cycle through agents and check each.
- **Canvas** = spatial, all-at-once supervision and broadcast.

See [view-modes](view-modes.md).

## Gotchas for agents

- A "book" is a **worktree**; a tab slot is a **tab** within it.
- Agent badges belong to the terminal surface's owning worktree. If an agent is
  running from a different working directory, the full Active Agents panel still
  shows the resolved repository/branch context.
- Closing the last tab of a book removes the book from the shelf.
- The book-switching keys (`⌘⌃←/→`) and tab-cycling keys (`⌘⌃↑/↓`) differ only
  by arrow direction — be precise when describing them.
